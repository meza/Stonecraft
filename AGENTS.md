## Bob's Working Memory

- Maintain session-to-session context in `bob-memory.md` (kept at the repo root).
- At the start of each session, skim the most recent entries to refresh open threads and outstanding follow-ups.
- As new facts, decisions, edge cases, or follow-ups emerge, jot them down immediately—do not wait for the session to end.
- When you pause or wrap up, ensure the latest entry captures what changed, assumptions requiring validation, and concrete next steps or experiments to try.
- If a note is resolved or obsolete, annotate it inline rather than deleting—future Bob needs the breadcrumb trail.
- Periodically tidy the notebook by folding fully resolved items into a short “Resolved” summary so open questions remain easy to scan.
- Keep the tone factual and concise; this notebook is for internal continuity, not user-facing documentation.
