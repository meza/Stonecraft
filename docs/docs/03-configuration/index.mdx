# Stonecraft Configuration

Stonecraft was created to have sensible defaults requiring little to no configuration.

The function of the plugin is to make sure that the underlying systems are configured in a consistent manner.
It takes care of the boilerplate and wires up the necessary directories across all the other plugins involved.

For the sake of finding what you are looking for, all the settings are listed in the sidebar so you can jump to the one you need.

## Main Configuration

Stonecraft is configured via the [`modSettings`](01-modsettings.md) block. Before you click on it and start configuring,
it is important to understand the distinction between the root project and the submodules.

## Project vs. Root Project

When using [Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev/) especially with Stonecraft, there are a few terms that are used that might not be immediately clear.

The way Stonecutter works is that it creates as many submodules for your project as many `minecraftVersion-loader` pairings you have.

:::info
For example if you have `1.17.1-fabric` and `1.17.1-forge` in your `versions` list, you will have two submodules in your project.
If you have support for 4 different Minecraft versions and 3 different loaders, you will have 12 submodules.
:::

When dealing with your gradle configuration in such a project, you need to distinguish between the root project and the submodules.

### Root Project

In the gradle configuration, you refer to the root project as `rootProject`.
This will always refer to the `build.gradle.kts` file in the root of your project.

### Submodules

When you are configuring settings for the version specific submodules that live in the `versions` folder, you refer to them as `project`.

## Dealing with folders and files

Stonecraft settings are all set up to work with `Directory` and `File` objects.
These are usually always derived from the `project` or the `rootProject` objects.

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
modSettings {
    runDirectory = rootProject.layout.projectDirectory.dir("run")
    fabricClientJunitReportLocation = project.layout.buildDirectory.file("fabric-client-junit-report.xml")
}
```

In the example above, `runDirectory` is set to a directory in the root project, while `fabricClientJunitReportLocation`
is set to a file in the submodule.

This means that for every single `minecraftVersion-loader` pairing in the `versions` folder, you will have a
`build/fabric-client-junit-report.xml` file separately for each.

:::note
It is always advisable to use the `layout` helper functions to create these objects as they provide the correct types
and are more robust.

## Outside the modSettings block

the [`modSettings`](01-modsettings.md) block is Stonecraft's main configuration block.
Stonecraft is made to use consistent file and directory providers and it translates them into the correct types for the plugins involved.

When you are configuring loom, fabric-api, or any other plugin, you will have to refer to their documentation to figure out what
types you need.

Some expect relative paths, some expect strings, and some expect `File` or `Directory` objects.

You're always better off deriving all of those from the `project` or `rootProject` objects for consistency's sake.
