# Releasing Mods

The built in publisher is the [mod-publish-plugin][mod-publish-plugin].

When you are using the built in `chiseledPublishMods` command, you only need to override the things that are unique
to your mod.

Here is an example of how to set up the `publishMods` block for a mod that is both Modrinth and Curseforge:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
publishMods {
    modrinth {
        if (mod.isFabric) {
            requires("fabric-api")
            optional("modmenu")
        }
        requires("cloth-config")
    }

    curseforge {
        clientRequired = false
        serverRequired = true
        if (mod.isFabric) {
            requires("fabric-api")
            optional("modmenu")
        }
        requires("cloth-config")
    }
}
```

The name of the files, setting the version, the loader and other metadata is handled by Stonecraft.
You can override the default values by setting them in the `publishMods` block as you would with the [mod-publish-plugin][mod-publish-plugin].

## Environment Variables

There are a few environment variables that you *must* set depending on your project.

### Publishing on Modrinth

| Environment Variable | Description                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| MODRINTH_TOKEN       | The token used to authenticate with Modrinth. |
| MODRINTH_ID          | The ID of the project on Modrinth.            |

### Publishing on Curseforge

| Environment Variable | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| CURSEFORGE_TOKEN     | The token used to authenticate with Curseforge. |
| CURSEFORGE_ID        | The ID of the project on Curseforge.            |
| CURSEFORGE_SLUG      | The project slug on Curseforge.                 |

### Other Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DO_PUBLISH           | Set to `true` to publish the mod. <br/>This translates to the mod-publish-plugin's dryRun setting's opposite                           |
| RELEASE_TYPE         | The type of release. <br/>This can be one of `alpha`, `beta` or `stable`<br/>If a value is not recognized, it will default to `stable` |

## Release Types

Release types are used to determine the type of release you are making. In terms of Minecraft mods, it's usually
used to determine if the mod is alpha, beta or stable release.

The simplest way to set this up is to use the `RELEASE_TYPE` environment variable in your CI/CD pipeline.

### GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, you can set the `RELEASE_TYPE` environment variable in your workflow file.
This looks at the branch name and sets the release type accordingly.
the `main` branch is set to `release`, the `beta` branch is set to `beta`, the `alpha` branch is set to `alpha` and everything else is set to `snapshot`.

Ideally you wouldn't call publish on anything but the main, alpha and beta branches.

```yaml
env:
  RELEASE_TYPE: ${{ endsWith(github.ref_name, 'main') && 'release' || (endsWith(github.ref_name, 'beta') && 'beta' || (endsWith(github.ref_name, 'alpha') && 'alpha') || 'snapshot') }}
```

### Setting it manually

You can of course set the release type in your build file manually.

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
publishMods {
    // highlight-next-line
    type=ReleaseType.BETA
    modrinth {
        if (mod.isFabric) {
            requires("fabric-api")
            optional("modmenu")
        }
        requires("cloth-config")
    }

    curseforge {
        clientRequired = false
        serverRequired = true
        if (mod.isFabric) {
            requires("fabric-api")
            optional("modmenu")
        }
        requires("cloth-config")
    }
}
```

### Semantic Release - version string parser

Me (Meza), I'm a big fan of [semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) and I think it should be the default way to release software.
It's not only a great way to automate the release process, but it also helps you keep track of the changes in your project and deal with versioning.

It does require a bit of setup, and to get used to the [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), but it's worth it in the end.

:::info
**To support this flow, Stonecraft automatically attempts to determine the release type based on the version string of the project.**
:::

- If a version contains the word "alpha", it will be treated as an alpha release.
- If a version contains the word "beta", it will be treated as a beta release.
- If a version contains the word "next", it will be treated as a beta release. (This is useful when you use the @next terminology from the npm ecosystem)

:::tip
If you don't want this behavior, you can set the `RELEASE_TYPE` environment variable and that will override the version string parser.
:::

The above however sets the release type for the entire project.

### Setting the release type for a specific mod

You can set the release type for a specific mod by using the `is_snapshot` property in the `versions/dependencies/[miencraft_version].properties` file.
Setting this to `true` will set the release type to `beta` and setting it to `false` will make Stonecraft behave normally.

```properties title="versions/dependencies/1.21.4.properties"
is_snapshot=true
```

If you are curious about how this works, checkout the [SoundsBeGone mod](https://github.com/meza/SoundsBeGone) or the
[Inventory Sorter mod](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/Inventory-Sorter) where I use this technique to release the mod.

If you're still curious, join discord and ask me about it. I love talking about this stuff. (link in the footer)
