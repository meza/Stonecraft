# What is Stonecraft?

Stonecraft is a configuration Gradle plugin designed to eliminate the boilerplate involved in setting up a **multi-loader, multi-version** Minecraft modding workspace. It leverages [Stonecutter][stonecutter] and [Architectury][architectury] to provide comprehensive multi-loader and multi-version support.

- **Multi-loader _(Architectury)_**: Supports Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge, enabling mod development for each loader within the same workspace.
- **Multi-version _(Stonecutter)_**: Supports multiple Minecraft versions, allowing mod development across different versions in a unified workspace.
- **Single codebase**: Develop mods for various loaders and versions within a single codebase, eliminating the need to maintain multiple branches or separate workspaces.
- **Consistent release process**: Seamlessly release mods to Modrinth and CurseForge with accurate versioning and metadata for all loaders and Minecraft versions.

It sets sensible defaults for modloader **dependencies**, **data generation**, **GameTest framework** and the **Mod Publish** plugin.

Stonecraft reduces approximately 500 lines of repetitive `build.gradle.kts` code to a single line using a tested and versioned plugin.

:::info

This project was initially created to support [my projects](https://modrinth.com/user/meza) and is currently a **work in progress**. <br/>
However, I aim to make it valuable for others as well, so feedback and contributions are highly encouraged.

As this is my first attempt at developing a Gradle plugin and working with Kotlin, there’s certainly room for improvement. If you have suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, or enhancements, please open an issue or a pull request on the [GitHub repository][github].

:::warning

Stonecraft relies on your understanding of [Stonecutter][stonecutter].<br/>Please familiarize yourself with Stonecutter before using Stonecraft.

## What's Included?

### Stonecutter

Stonecraft configures Stonecutter to adapt your code based on the active Minecraft version and modloader.
This eliminates the need to manually manage separate configurations for each version and loader.

Instead of having to maintain separate git branches for each Minecraft version or modloader,
you can have a single codebase that adapts to the active environment.

This is achieved by using special comments in your code that are replaced by Stonecutter at compile time.

Don't be frightened by how this looks, Stonecutter will manage this for you.

:::note

    The above example only uses loaders for conditions but you can use Minecraft versions as well.

:::

Please refer to the [Stonecutter documentation][stonecutter] for more information, you will need it!
Alternatively you can check out the [Server Redstone Block mod](https://github.com/meza/ServerRedstoneBlock/tree/main)
for inspiration.

### Architectury

Architectury is a fork of fabric-loom which coordinates the setup of a multi-loader project.
Stonecraft configures Architectury to support Fabric, Forge and NeoForge with more loaders to come.

### Mappings

As of version 1.7.0, Stonecraft defaults to using Mojang's official Mojmap mappings for all supported Minecraft versions.
The main reasons behind this change are described in my [blog post about the post-obfuscation world](/blog/post-obfuscation-stonecraft).

:::note
Stonecraft `1.7.x` is end-of-life. The mappings behavior described here still applies, but you should upgrade to a newer Stonecraft line for ongoing updates.
:::

#### Mojmap

This is the default. We use `loom.officialMojangMappings()` to enable Mojmap support in Loom.

#### Yarn Mappings

Using Yarn mappings is also possible and the 1.7.0 changes made sure that existing projects using Yarn are not affected.
To use Yarn mappings, simply add the usual `yarn_mappings` property in your [dependency files](/docs/Quickstart#creating-your-dependency-files)

When the `yarn_mappings` property is present, Stonecraft will automatically configure Loom to use Yarn mappings instead of Mojmap.

This includes setting up the necessary yarn patch for Neoforge.

### Mod-Publish-Plugin

Stonecraft includes the [Mod-Publish-Plugin](https://modmuss50.github.io/mod-publish-plugin/) which allows you to easily
publish your mods to Modrinth and Curseforge.
It's all configured in a way that you can publish your mod to all loaders and versions with a single command.

### Test client configuration

Stonecraft includes a way for you to set your minecraft client configuration for testing.
You can now avoid having your eyes and ears blown out by the default Minecraft settings.
